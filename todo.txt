* Weapon Synchronization between host and client
    - New boolean option "Synchronize weapons with host"
    - New boolean option "Show proper names"
    - Note: Synchronization should be performed on a request basis. As a host, this mod will respond to any weapon sync request. It is up to the client (who has this mod) to request weapon information to sync.
    - Potential issues: Vanilla hosts/clients may crash due to information request/response.
* More preview options
    - [IN PROGRESS] At the end of weapon part sections, add Preview (list of weapon, taser, ... other enemies), add Animation (list of animations)
    - [DONE] Preview will spawn either the weapon to preview or it will spawn a unit with the currently opened weapon. Enemies spawned are _husk so they do not spawn on other client's screens.
    - [IN PROGRESS] Animation will apply a specific animation to either the weapon or the spawned unit
    - User can press "space" to hide all ui to take screenshots. User can press "esc" or "space" to restore the ui.
    - Add "Don't sync weapon" boolean, when enabled this weapon will not be synchronized with host. Disabled it will obey the Global Synch option.
